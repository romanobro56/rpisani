The Dorm Buddy is a hub placed above the door of any shared living space that allows its users to indicate the room\'s status with a remote, and check that status, temperature, humidity and more through a web interface. I created the interface using NextJS, NodeJS MongoDB, Express, Bcrypt and plain CSS.',
