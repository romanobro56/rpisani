## About Me

I'm a **Software Engineer and AI/ML Developer** at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. I specialize in building **production-scale machine learning systems**, **full-stack applications**, and **cloud infrastructure** that drive measurable business impact.

At **Chewy**, I worked on the team that developed ML and GenAI AI systems that have **accelerated prescription processing by 10x** (72 hours → 6 hours). My work includes building knowledge graphs with **billions of clinical records** and production ML models with **95% accuracy**.

Previously at **Intuit Credit Karma**, I architected a secure, cross-platform user flow that **prevents $50K+ in monthly fraud losses** and **reduced customer service calls by 10%**.

I'm passionate about leveraging AI and software engineering to solve complex, high-impact problems.
